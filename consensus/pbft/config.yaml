general:

    # Operational mode: currently only batch ( this value is case-insensitive)
    mode: batch

    # Maximum number of validators/replicas we expect in the network
    # Keep the "N" in quotes, or it will be interpreted as "false".
    "N": 4

    # Number of byzantine nodes we will tolerate
    f: 1

    # Checkpoint period is the maximum number of pbft requests that must be
    # re-processed in a view change. A smaller checkpoint period will decrease
    # the amount of time required to recover from an error, but will decrease
    # overall throughput in normal case operation.
	#
	# Checkpoint Period : view change시에 재처리되어야할 pbft request의 MAX건수
	# 작게 잡으면 에러를 복구시간이 단축되지만, 정상케이스 처리시의 overall throughput도 감소됨.
    K: 10

    # Affects the receive log size which is K * logmultiplier
    # The primary will only send sequence numbers which fall within K * logmultiplier/2 of
    # its high watermark, so this cannot be set to less than 2
    # For high volume/high latency environments, a higher log size may increase throughput
	#
	# 수신 로그 사이즈는 K(checkpoint period) * logmultiplier에 비례.
	# 2미만으로는 설정할 수 없음
	# High volume/high latency 환경에서는 로그 용량을 늘려 throughput 증가.
    logmultiplier: 4

    # How many requests should the primary send per pre-prepare when in "batch" mode
	#
	# "batch" 모드에서 primary는 pre-prepare 할때마다 몇번의 request를 전송하는지?
    batchsize: 500

    # Whether the replica should act as a byzantine one; useful for debugging on testnets
    byzantine: false

    # After how many checkpoint periods the primary gets cycled automatically.  Set to 0 to disable.
	#
	# primary의 checkpoint period가 자동으로 재설정 되는 횟수가 몇번인지 세팅. 0이면 미설정.
    viewchangeperiod: 0

    # Timeouts
    timeout:

        # Send a pre-prepare if there are pending requests, batchsize isn't reached yet,
        # and this much time has elapsed since the current batch was formed
        batch: 1s

        # How long may a request take between reception and execution, must be greater than the batch timeout
		#
		# reception과 execution 사이의 타임아웃 설정, batch 타임아웃보다는 커야함.
        request: 2s

        # How long may a view change take
        viewchange: 2s

        # How long to wait for a view change quorum before resending (the same) view change
		#
		# viewchange 재전송시 타임아웃
        resendviewchange: 2s

        # Interval to send "keep-alive" null requests.  Set to 0 to disable. If enabled, must be greater than request timeout
		#
		# 내부적인 keep-alive null request 타임아웃, 0이면 미설정. request timeout(2초)보다는 커야함.
        nullrequest: 0s

        # How long may a message broadcast take.
        broadcast: 1s
